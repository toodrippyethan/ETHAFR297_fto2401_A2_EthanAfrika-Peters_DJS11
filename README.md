Built using modern frontend technologies, including React and JavaScript, this project fetches podcast data from a public API to dynamically display shows, seasons, and episodes. Users can explore a variety of genres, sort shows alphabetically, listen to episodes, and manage their favorites seamlessly. By leveraging endpoints like https://podcast-api.netlify.app/, the app ensures up-to-date content and robust functionality. Whether you're a podcast enthusiast or new to the medium, this app offers an intuitive interface to discover and enjoy podcasts effortlessly.
